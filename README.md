# AstroWideImageMapper
Digitally label wide-angle images of any format with with directional azimuth and altitude, to include the "shape" of the image so the angular direction of each pixel is known.

## What Already Exists

In a world of seemingly-infinite technology, some notes to avoid “re-inventing the wheel” and to enable maximum future flexibility:
1.	JPEG, PNG, and RAW are sufficient to cover every type of human-viewable 2-D image one can imagine (at least 99% of practical applications), so let’s stick with what works already. JPEG covers an extreme range of resolutions with sufficient compression for reasonable file sizes. PNG includes transparency at the expense of larger file size. RAW covers uncompressed high-detail ignoring file size.
2.	See list of related / similar software at:

3.	Users should be able to calibrate their own camera with readily-available equipment. The goal is to demystify the idea of angular direction of photographs.
4.	Location (on Earth) and time data are already covered extensively by EXIF, both within the GPS section and outside of it.
5.	Altitude: directional altitude of a photograph is easily obtainable digitally by gravity sensors that know a camera’s direction to fraction-of-a-degree accuracy. However! The data is not included in EXIF and even top-end professional cameras do not show this data to the user.
	a.	Professional cameras (to my knowledge) show only “level or not,” they do not give the user the actual number.
	b.	There exist various *free* “angle finder” phone apps that work great because of built-in sensors in modern smart phones.
	c.	Angle finders are available for carpenters for about $30 at Home Depot, Amazon, etc. (annoyingly, almost all contain an extremely strong magnet designed to allow the user to stick the device to whatever metal is to be leveled – I was nervous about the magnet near my camera so I removed the magnet).
6.	Azimuth is not easy digitally. The primary physical phenomenon that would tell an electronic device its azimuth orientation is Earth’s magnetic field. Unlike gravity (and besides magnetic variation, which is easily-calculable) Earth’s magnetic field is weak and very distorted. For example, using phone apps and compasses alike in a relatively rural location, I was recording azimuth values that were +/- 30°. Speculation: difficulty in azimuth is probably the sole reason directional data is not already included in EXIF.
	a.	Question: can GPS signals be used by a receiver with directional antennae to determine its azimuth orientation? I have never heard this question asked.
7.	The data should be text. While there may be some computer efficiency advantage to some other data format, modern computers can quickly convert text into whatever format it prefers and HUMANS CAN READ TEXT. (some EXIF data is specifically not text, and it is very annoying to work with). Being that EXIF is already so widely distributed, AWIM data should “piggy-back” onto or be added directly to existing EXIF data.

Finally, an example of AWIM data text, generated by the AstroWideImageMapper:
